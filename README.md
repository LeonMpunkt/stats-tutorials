# stats-tutorials

Tutorials for my classes, using R.

A work in flux, maybe even progress.

## Contents

`/tutorials` contains the tutorials as html, along with the Rmarkdown files used to generate them.

`tutorials/data` contains the data files used in the tutorials, mostly in csv format.

## Structure

The introductory tutorials are best read in order:

1. Introduction
2. Data types
3. Files
4. Packages

Later tutorials assume familiarity with the introductory materials, but otherwise stand alone and can be consulted in any order:

* Dimension reduction

## Packages

R packages loaded in the tutorials:
* `MASS`
* `readxl`
* `haven`
* `ggplot2`
* `psych`
