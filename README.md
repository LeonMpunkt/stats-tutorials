# stats-tutorials
Tutorials for my classes, using R.

A work in flux, maybe even progress.

`/html` contains the tutorials as html, directly viewable in a web browser.

`/Rmd` contains the Rmarkdown files that generated the html files.

`/data` contains the data files used in the tutorials, in `.csv` format.
